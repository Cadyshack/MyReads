# MyReads Project

This is my version of the MyReads project from Udacity React Nanodegree that is forked from [reactnd-project-myreads-starter](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter) and used as a starter template. This starter template was created using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) to bootstrap the project.


## TL;DR

To get started developing right away:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

## Prerequisites

You'll need npm installed on your machine in order to install all the dependencies found in `package.json`

## Installing

As stated above, simply install all project dependencies with `npm install`:

* In Terminal, navigate to the MyReads folder holding all the files downloaded from this repository, then from within this folder inside Terminal type `npm install`
* Once all the dependencies are installed, from within this same project folder inside Terminal, type `npm start` and the development server will start.


## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

## Contributing

This repository is created as a course project for the Udacity React Nanodegree program. Therefore, I most likely will not accept pull requests.
